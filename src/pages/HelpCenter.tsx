    question: "How accurate is the symptom checker?",
    answer: "Our symptom checker uses a comprehensive database of medical conditions and symptoms to provide possible matches. However, it's important to note that it's meant to be informational only and not a replacement for professional medical advice. The accuracy can vary depending on the specificity of symptoms entered."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my health information secure?",
    answer: "Yes, we take data privacy very seriously. All health information you enter is encrypted and stored securely. We do not share your personal health information with third parties without your explicit consent. You can read more about our privacy practices in our Privacy Policy."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I contact a doctor through the app?",
    answer: "In the 'Contact Doctors' section, you can browse through our network of healthcare professionals. Each doctor's profile includes their contact information. You can call or email them directly to schedule an appointment. In the future, we plan to implement an in-app appointment booking system."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I trust the recommended home remedies?",
    answer: "Our home remedies are sourced from traditional medicine practices and contemporary research. However, they should be used with caution and are not meant to replace medical treatment. Always consult with a healthcare professional before trying any remedy, especially if you have existing health conditions or are taking medications."
  },
  {
    question: "How are the diet plans created?",
    answer: "Our diet plans are based on Ayurvedic principles and modern nutritional science. They are designed to provide general guidance based on body types (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) and weight management goals. For personalized nutrition advice tailored to your specific health needs, we recommend consulting with a registered dietitian or nutritionist."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I provide feedback about the app?",
    answer: "We value your feedback! You can share your thoughts through our Feedback page, where you can rate our app and leave detailed comments. Your insights help us improve and provide better service to all users."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a way to save my health history in the app?",
    answer: "Currently, we do not have a feature to save your health history, but we're working on implementing this in a future update. This will allow you to track your symptoms over time and share your history with healthcare providers."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do in a medical emergency?",
    answer: "This app is not designed for emergencies. If you're experiencing a medical emergency, please call emergency services (e.g., 911 in the US) immediately or go to your nearest emergency room. Do not wait for app responses in urgent situations."
